## We analysed trip duration to get some idea about the users and usage of this service
### Based on the graph we can say users usually borrow the bike for less than 20 minutes, so we can assume most of the customer use the service for comminucating not for entertainment or recreation.

## Pick time analysis
### We used heat-map graph to show the pick time of using this service during the weekday and per customer types and gender
### During the weekday pick time of using the service are 7 to 9 am in the morning and 5 to 7 pm in the afternoon. This another reason to support this assumption which most of the users used the service for comminucating to work. 
### On the weekend 10 am to 7 pm are the pick time of using bike sharing service which should be for recreation and entertainment purpose. 
### Based on the user types and gender we can say Thursday and Friday and then monday and Tuesday are the pick time for male subscriber users during the week. 

# Summary
## One of the major area which should be consider for runnign this program would be business restrict area. 
## We should add subscription method for bike sharing program with some promotion to get more loyal customer.
## Important Up time of the bike would be early in the morning and evening at the end of the business hour.
## Service time should be set up in low demand time like the middle of the day or weekend. 
## Mens used this service more than womens, so I recomend to use more male style bike than female style in bike-sharing program
